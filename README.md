# SlimeTrail-QT
Small game made using QT (feat Alline S. Ferreira) made in the third semester of college.

>Status: Complete!

## Technologies used: 
  * C++
  * [FrameWork Qt](https://qt.io/developers)

## Task:
Develop a graphical application that simulates the game Rastros (http://www.iggamecenter.com/info/en/slimetrail.html), where two players compete to be the winner. The game has an 8x8 board divided into 64 squares. Each player has a target square, where the bottom-left corner (square 8,1 - row 8 and column 1) belongs to one player and the top-right corner (square 1,8 - row 1 and column 8) belongs to the other player. The players take turns moving a shared piece that starts near the center of the board (square 4,5 - row 4 and column 5). This piece must be moved to a neighboring square horizontally, vertically, or diagonally, as long as it reaches a previously unvisited square. The player whose piece reaches their target square wins, regardless of who moved it. A draw is declared if there are no possible moves for this piece.

## How to run the application:
  * First, [download](https://sourceforge.net/projects/mingw/files/OldFiles/) and install the compiler.
  * Then [download](https://qt.io/developers) FrameWork Qt and install it.

  * Open the project with Qt application.
